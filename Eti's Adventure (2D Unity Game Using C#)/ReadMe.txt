This is a 2D Adventure Game currently acting as a prototype to get feedback

Average Time for a user to complete the game : 90 minutes (either by beating the game or losing all their lives)

This game is made using Unity Engine (used for creating game applications) and the primary programming language used is C#. The project has 1000's of lines of code and approximately 30 different scripts for different functionality. The game can be played by extracting the folder and clicking on exe file.

The game uses advanced OOP methodologies and a prototype SDLC is used for developing it. It is currently in the feedback gathering stages. 

Basic Introduction to the Functionality:

1. 2D Game with the character having the ability to jump, move and shoot
2. Different mobs with different abilities
3. 2D terrain made using different tilemaps and tile rules
4. A boss mob with unique functionalies
5. Different puzzles such as match based puzzles where shapes have to be matched to progress and pattern based puzzles which are made up of gamified IQ questions (these have built in timer and can only be done once)
6. Difficult terrain using different hazards
7. The game currently only has one difficulty stage (easier version will be available later)
8. A UI for the menu (including instructions). Canvases used in the game to show player stats
9. Inventory system
10. Checkpoint system with teleportation between different points
11. Tutorial available
12. Added more statistics and background music

The primary objective of the game is to provide a fun experience to players while also focusing on learning outcomes.
Majority of the reported bugs are fixed. Currently working on
1. Music and sound effects
2. Storing more statistics such as total mobs killed or time taken
3. A save method (since the prototype is a single level expected to be completed in one sitting, the save method will only be used to save stats once the run is completed)
