!This is currently in progress

The project is built using XAMPP (Apache and MYSQL) and requires you to set up the Connection.php accordingly

Functionality:

1. User can store the total amount of hours they have worked on into the database
2. Getting data from the database and showcasing all the tasks completed and the amount of hours worked (with decent filtering capabilities)
3. A line and a bar graph to show the the current and previous weekly tasks

If the connection doesn't work or if there are issues with opening the files using XAMPP,
then I have added some pictures in the folder that can be used to see the functionality
