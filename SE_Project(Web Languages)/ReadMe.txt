This is a project, used in showcasing HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills

The project has multiple users (Admins, Managers, Consultants). Each user has different tasks hence they have different functionality

These functionalities are only to showcase the frontend (Data is not being saved)

PHP is used only for login purposes in this case (Used XAMPP (Apache and MySQL)) however a separate folder that doesn't use PHP is also uploaded

Functionality:

1. Each user has a separate page dedicated to them
2. Creating a user (admin)
3. Removing a user (admin)
4. Edit Timesheet (Consultant)
5. Assess Timesheet (Manager)

Please go over each user page to see the functionality, the styling and the use of JS functions
